In the rapidly evolving field of Internet of Vehicles technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has garnered considerable attention due to its superior performance in terms of coverage, latency, and throughput. Efficient resource allocation in C-V2X networks is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety-critical information in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication.

In this paper, we propose **Dynamic-aware Graph-based Proximal Policy Optimization (DGPPO)**, a novel approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning to effectively tackle the challenges of joint spectrum and power allocation in C-V2X networks. 

The proposed approach constructs a dynamic graph representation where communication links are modeled as nodes, allowing for flexible modeling of network topology changes. Next, we utilize an adaptive GNN to extract essential low-dimensional features for policy learning, enabling efficient and robust dynamic resource allocation in vehicular networks.
